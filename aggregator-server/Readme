A server to aggregate punch cards spread across punch clocks in multiple jvm's.

In the case of apache-storm, we can have Punch clocks in multiple worker jvm's

This server aggregates and exposes REST api's like
getPunchCards , deactivatePunchClock , activatePunchClock , clearAllPunchClock

how to compile/start the server:

mvn clean compile package; # at the top level.
cd aggregator-server/target

java -jar aggregator-server.jar <path_to_config.yaml>

sample config yaml: (which has list of server to aggregate from)

punchClockJmxUrls:
    - service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://10.0.0.66:9010/jmxrmi
    - service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://10.0.0.68:9011/jmxrmi

then go to the browser:
http://localhost:4567/PunchCards

other rest api(s)
POST /clear       (clear entries in the storm punch clock on all jvm)

POST /deactivate  (deactivate the storm punch clock on all jvm)

POST /activate    (activate the storm punch clock on all jvm)

For the Demo: run the sample storm topology in storm samples
